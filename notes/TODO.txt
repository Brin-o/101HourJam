Things to do:
1. Character movement
	a. [Done!] Turn around when reaching a wall
	b. [Done-ish]Start/Pause on button input
		//Right now this just sets the player speed. Probablly need to change it to some global vairable.
	Improvments:
		1. Juice!
			a. Make the player bouncy when it's moving
			b. Scale it up a bit when it bumps into a wall and scale it back ("pop" it)
		2. Collision system is checking for solid objects, what about enemies? (Collision events maybe?) 
		
2. Trapdoor that the player can move over
	a. One of the following
		a1. [Done] Click on ground to place a trapdoor
			//This is done. Esentially it just removes the collision tag and plays a fancy animation.
			Improvments:
				a. Replace the sprite of the tile with an actual trap door!
				b. Create an "opening the trapdoor animation" and figure out how that would work?
				
		a2. Click on a preplaced trapdoor to open it
		
3. Obstacles/Rewards
	a. Chest/Mummy wrapping paper (toilet paper?)
	b. Spikes
		b1. Spikes that move up and down into the ground! (use EasyTweenMove)
	c. patroling enemy like a raider/mummy
		c1. Can probablly reuse the character movement script
		
4. Scoring system
